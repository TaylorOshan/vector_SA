vector spatial autocorrelation
-------------------------------

Experiment using the [PySAL](https://github.com/pysal/pysal) Moran's I class to template a vector autocorrelation measure from Liu, Tong, and Liu (2014). 

 Included a "slag" method because it needed to be customized to accomomdate array nature of "z". Perhaps there is a better solution that does not require a custom method. 

## Todo:

- Add routines for simulating random permutations from Liu, Ting, and Liu (2014)
  for hypothesis testing.
